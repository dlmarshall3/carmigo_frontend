## Project description

This application exists because I was given the assignment to create a full-stack application in: Vue.js, Node.js/Express, and postgreSQL. I had never touched any of these frameworks/libraries before starting this project, but needless to say, I've had a great time. Thank you, Sean, for giving me this opportunity!

## Criteria

I was asked to create a full-stack application where a user could add, remove, and update vehicles from a databse with an interactive user interface. As mentioned above, I used Vue.js, Node.js/Express, and postgreSQL to comlpete these assessment. The front end is deployed via Surge, which you can access in several parts of this readme/page, and the backend is deployed via Heroku.

## Challenges

Apart from, you know, figuring out how to work in these libraries and build my first fullstack application in a week, I ran into a lot of hurdles. First: deploying to Heroku was a nightmare in a half. Second: I built my backend TWICE, because the first time, I genuinely had no idea what I was doing. Third: Balancing all of this learning and work with everything else in life. Just because I have an assessment to do doesn't mean I need to ignore my family. Or, in this instance, not celebrate Christmas! What a weekend.

## Thank you

Again, thank you to Sean for this opportunity. Huge shout-out to all of my mentors and friends who offered encouragement during this long, but rewarding, week. And, most importantly, to my wife and kids for pushing me to ~~~be the best there ever was.~~~ (Just kidding. Because let's be honest: Ash Ketchum definitely is not, and will never be, the best there ever was.)
